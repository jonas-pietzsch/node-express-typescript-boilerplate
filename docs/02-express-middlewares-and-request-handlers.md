## 2 – Express Middlewares and Request Handlers

Now the server application gets its first REST API endpoint implemented. So start the server using `npm start` and visit:

1. `http://localhost:8000/api/cat/1` – It responds with a 404
2. `http://localhost:8000/api/cat/123` – It responds with a 200 and very little information about a cat
